# Week 7 - Comparisons, Compositions, and Time

This week we talked about showing comparisons, composition, and a little bit of
time series plotting.

## Slides and Examples

The slides for this week's lecture can be found in this directory (`lecture_week07.pdf`)
and the original slides [are
online](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sYhbuzU2HQtyRquyr4ER7b8g_FW2WwhBVrWE7qXefr0).

The notebook is in this directory (`examples_week07.ipynb`).

## Homework 6: Time Series Analysis

Your task is to design a static visualization that you believe effectively communicates the data and provide a short write-up (no more than 4 paragraphs) describing your design. While you must use the data set given, note that you are free to transform the data as you see fit. You are also free to incorporate external data as you see fit. Your chart image should be interpretable without recourse to your short write-up. Do not forget to include title, axis labels or legends as needed!
