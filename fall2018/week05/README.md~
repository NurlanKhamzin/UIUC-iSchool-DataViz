# Week 6 - Types of Viz and Choosing Colors

This week we discussed a decision-tree for choosing a visualization method, and
then spent time discussing how choosing colors can change how individuals
understand a visualization.

## Slides and Examples

The slides for this week's lecture can be found in this directory (`lecture_week06.pdf`)
and the original slides [are
online](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Jlj-qfVrwDd_hoQavcIHWzh3yZG0XQBUMhqoSiA04rA/edit?usp=sharing).

This week, we did a different type of notebook presentation.  We utilized most
of our time discussing colormaps and exploring them through pre-prepared
notebooks.

You can find these notebooks here in this directory, named
`examples_color01.ipynb`, `examples_color02.ipynb`, and
`examples_color03.ipynb`.

## Homework 5: Vizualizations

In this assignment, you will design a visualization for a small data set and provide a rigorous rationale for your design choices. You should in theory be ready to explain the contribution of every pixelin the display. You are free to use any graphics or charting tool you please--including drafting it by hand. However, you may find it most instructive to create the chart from scratch using a graphics API of your choice.

Your task is to design a static (i.e., single image) visualization that you believe effectively communicates the data and provide a short write-up (no more than 4 paragraphs) describing your design. While you must use the data set given, note that you are free to transform the data as you see fit. You are also free to incorporate external data as you see fit. Your chart image should be interpretable without recourse to your short write-up. Do not forget to include title, axis labels or legends as needed!

As different visualizations can emphasize different aspects of a data set, you should document what aspects of the data you are attempting to most effectively communicate. In short, what story (or stories) are you trying to tell? Just as important, also note which aspects of the data might be obscured or down-played due to your visualization design.

In your write-up, you should provide a rigorous rationale for your design decisions. Document the visual encodings you used and why they are appropriate for the data. These decisions include the choice of visualization type, size, color, scale, and other visual elements, as well as the use of sorting or other data transformations. How do these decisions facilitate effective communication?

After the World War II, antibiotics were considered as "wonder drugs", since they were easy remedy for what had been intractable ailments. To learn which drug worked most effectively for which bacterial infection, performance of the three most popular antibiotics on 16 bacteria were gathered.

The values in the table represent the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), a measure of the effectiveness of the antibiotic, which represents the concentration of antibiotic required to prevent growth in vitro. The reaction of the bacteria to Gram staining is described by the covariate “gram staining”. Bacteria that are stained dark blue or violet are Gram-positive. Otherwise, they are Gram-negative.
