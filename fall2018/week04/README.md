# Week 4 - A Palette of Operations, and Python Classes

This week we covered a few concepts in data transformation as well as how to
write Python classes and use them to build up a palette of operations to apply
to data and figures.

## Slides and Examples

The slides for this week's lecture can be found in this directory (`lecture_week04.pdf`)
and the original slides [are
online](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LEZftQS3ZDP_UqPgRBm0jXUhjqPdXf0M9Ypf2I9tmGk/).


The example notebook is in this directory (`examples_week04.ipynb`) and the
dataset used in it can be found on the [data repository
site](https://girder.hub.yt/#item/588b65a44085f90001229e98).

## Homework 3: Python Classes
Create a python program with a python class that is able to represent each of the following:
* Create a line plot showing the number of marriages and divorces per capita in the U.S. between 1867 and 1880
    * Label both lines and show the legend
* Create a line plot showing the number of marriages and divorces per capita in the U.S. between 1875 and 1881
   * Label both lines and show the legend
