# Week 6 - Types of Viz and Choosing Colors

This week we discussed a decision-tree for choosing a visualization method, and
then spent time discussing how choosing colors can change how individuals
understand a visualization.

## Slides and Examples

The slides for this week's lecture can be found in this directory (`lecture_week06.pdf`)
and the original slides [are

This week, we did a different type of notebook presentation.  We utilized most
of our time discussing colormaps and exploring them through pre-prepared
notebooks.

You can find these notebooks here in this directory, named
`examples_color01.ipynb`, `examples_color02.ipynb`, and
`examples_color03.ipynb`.
