This week we had an introduction to Pandas and Bokeh.

## Slides and Examples

The slides for this week's lecture can be found in this directory (`lecture_week08.pdf`)
and the original slides [are
online](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A9uDN0FtRIW7vJvNekHRxxr4LHU-AyVJDU3ahjAiRPg/edit).

There are three notebooks in this directory; one is about pandas, and two are
about bokeh.

## Homework 7: Playing with Bokeh

I want you to use the data you have to investigate the question if the US (Senate) is the most divided it has ever been, as was reported by Forbes in 2013. While there may be no right or wrong answer to this question, there certainly are wrong ways of answering the question. If you are unsure about what trends you want to show, talk to me before
starting to code. Further, try to adhere to the following principles in your visualization:
1. Do not use more dimensions (color, shape, size, etc.) than you need. Having circles appear
both larger and darker due to more divisiveness is redundant.

2. Convey only relevant information – think of the message your graphic is meant to present;
for each piece of information, ask yourself if the graphic would work equally well without!
3. Make use of bokeh’s functionalities!
