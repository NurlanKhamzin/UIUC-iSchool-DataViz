# Week 11 - Maps and Vega

This week we spent most of the time discussing map projections, and then using
the online vega editor to explore how to use Vega Lite for visualizations.

## Slides and Examples

The slides for this week's lecture can be found in this directory (`lecture_week11.pdf`)
and the original slides [are
online](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C2jB3rZG3uiUuHhpIbVckDAsQ5NU1KVP3VjQn9sXmMQ/edit).

We used the [Vega Lite online
editor](https://vega.github.io/new-editor/#/vega_lite) on the [Vega Lite
website](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/).
